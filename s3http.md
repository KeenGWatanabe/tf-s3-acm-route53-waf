An "httpd web server" like `Apache is a dedicated software application that runs on a server to serve web pages by processing HTTP requests`, while "hosting a static website on S3" refers to storing your static website files on Amazon S3 cloud storage, which can then act as a simple web server by enabling static website hosting functionality, essentially allowing you to serve your website directly from the storage service without needing a separate web server application like Apache; meaning `S3 is both the storage and the basic web server for your static content` in this scenario. 
# Key differences:
`Functionality`:
A traditional web server like Apache is designed to handle complex website requests, including dynamic content generation, while S3 primarily focuses on storing data and only provides basic static website hosting capabilities when configured as such. 
`Flexibility`:
With a dedicated web server, you have more control over features and customization options, whereas S3 offers limited configuration for static website hosting. 
`Cost`:
Hosting a static website on S3 can often be cheaper than running a full-fledged web server, especially for simple websites with minimal traffic, as you only pay for the storage and data transfer used. 
# Example scenario:
# Using Apache:
If you have a website with a `database, user logins`, and dynamic content generated on the fly, you would typically set up a server with Apache (or similar) to handle these complex operations. 
# Using S3:
If you have a simple marketing landing page with only `static HTML, CSS, and images`, you could easily host it on S3 by uploading your files to a bucket and enabling static website hosting.
