Yes, an IAM policy is necessary if you want to control access to your S3 bucket. However, in your case, it seems like you are trying to create a publicly accessible S3 bucket for hosting a static website. For this scenario, you will need to configure a **bucket policy** to allow public read access to the objects in the bucket, rather than an IAM policy.

### Why a Bucket Policy is Necessary
- **Public Access**: To make the bucket publicly accessible, you need to attach a bucket policy that grants read access to everyone (`"Principal": "*"`).
- **Website Hosting**: Since you are enabling static website hosting, the bucket policy must allow public access to the objects so that users can access the website.

### Updated Terraform Code with Bucket Policy
Hereâ€™s how you can update your Terraform code to include a bucket policy for public access:

```hcl
# Create the S3 bucket
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "static_bucket" {
  bucket = "<ADD YOUR NAME HERE>.sctp-sandbox.com" # Naming convention <name>s3.sctp-sandbox.com
  force_destroy = true
}

# Block public access settings (optional, but recommended to disable if you want public access)
resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "enable_public_access" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.static_bucket.id

  block_public_acls       = false
  block_public_policy     = false
  ignore_public_acls      = false
  restrict_public_buckets = false
}

# Bucket policy to allow public read access
resource "aws_s3_bucket_policy" "allow_public_access" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.static_bucket.id

  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Sid       = "PublicReadGetObject"
        Effect    = "Allow"
        Principal = "*"
        Action    = "s3:GetObject"
        Resource  = "${aws_s3_bucket.static_bucket.arn}/*"
      }
    ]
  })
}

# Enable static website hosting
resource "aws_s3_bucket_website_configuration" "website" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.static_bucket.id

  index_document {
    suffix = "index.html"
  }

  error_document {
    key = "error.html"
  }
}

# Fetch the Route53 hosted zone
data "aws_route53_zone" "sctp_zone" {
  name = "sctp-sandbox.com"
}

# Create a Route53 record for the bucket
resource "aws_route53_record" "www" {
  zone_id = data.aws_route53_zone.sctp_zone.zone_id
  name    = "<ADD YOUR NAME HERE>" # Bucket prefix before sctp-sandbox.com
  type    = "A"

  alias {
    name                   = aws_s3_bucket_website_configuration.website.website_domain
    zone_id                = aws_s3_bucket.static_bucket.hosted_zone_id
    evaluate_target_health = true
  }
}
```

### Key Points:
1. **Bucket Policy**:
   - The `aws_s3_bucket_policy` resource allows public read access to all objects in the bucket (`s3:GetObject`).
   - The `Principal: "*"` grants access to everyone.

2. **Public Access Block**:
   - The `aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block` resource is configured to allow public access by setting all its arguments to `false`. This is necessary if you want the bucket to be publicly accessible.

3. **Static Website Hosting**:
   - The `aws_s3_bucket_website_configuration` resource enables static website hosting and specifies the index and error documents.

4. **Route53 Record**:
   - The `aws_route53_record` resource creates an alias record in Route53 that points to the S3 bucket's website endpoint.

### Important Notes:
- **Security Warning**: Making an S3 bucket publicly accessible can expose your data to the internet. Ensure that you only host static content that is safe to be public.
- **Replace Placeholders**: Replace `<ADD YOUR NAME HERE>` with your desired bucket name prefix and Route53 record name.
- **Error Document**: Ensure you upload an `error.html` file to the bucket if you specify it in the `aws_s3_bucket_website_configuration`.

This setup will allow you to host a static website on S3 and access it via a custom domain using Route53.
